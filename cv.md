Hello
My name is Alexander Popov.
Contacts: +375 (29) 642-59-75
Since childhood, I wanted to do programming, but something did not work out. And he went to study and work in another field. But after a few years I came across these courses, then I immediately learned from the friends of the developers about these courses and was pleasantly surprised when they said that these are some of the best courses. And without hesitation signed up. And he began to learn the basic skills of html, css and js. That would be even a little easier at the beginning of training.
I was only at the beginning of training and just started learning js.
He took courses in javarush, codeacademy, htmlacademy. I’m studying Ilya Kantor’s book “JavaScript” and solving problems from this book.
No specialty education. I study at the Belarusian State Technical University at the Faculty of Power Engineering.
English in the learning process.
